Can you write a python program, using type annotations, mypy for checking, and ruff with
black format for code formatting, that takes an apache log format string and one or more
log files, and processes them into clickhouse-local, then starts up a web server that
serves a web application that allows visualizing the web requests, specifically to try to
track down unusual requests like abuse?
